Commands
========

Please note that the administration commands are intended e.g. to bootstrap/install
an application to a new system, while the management ones are made to administer a
running application (to e.g. delete guest users, send emails, etc.).

Administration Commands
-----------------------

Use the ``wger`` command to perform different administration and bootstrapping
tasks such as initialising the database. You can get a list of all available
commands by calling ``wger`` without any arguments as well as help on a specific
command with ``wger --help <command>``.

Here are some of the most important ones:

``bootstrap``
  This command bootstraps the application: it creates a settings file, initialises
  a SQLite database, loads all necessary fixtures for the application to work and
  creates a default administrator user. While it can also work with e.g. a PostgreSQL
  database, you will need to create it yourself:

``create-settings``
  Creates a new settings file-based. If you call it without further arguments it
  will create the settings in the default locations:

``create-or-reset-admin``
  Makes sure that the default administrator user exists. If you change the password,
  it is reset.

``load-fixtures``
  loads all fixture files with the default data. This data includes all data necessary
  for the application to work such as:
  * exercises, muscles, equipment
  * ingredients, units
  * languages
  * permission groups
  * etc.

  Note that ingredients are not included and need to be installed separately with
  download-online-fixtures.

``load-online-fixtures``
  Downloads a subset of ingredients, the weight units fixtures and installs them.
  If you want to download all ingredients, you need to use the manage.py command
  with the ``sync-ingredients`` (see below).

  Downloads a subset of ingredients and the weight units fixtures, then installs
  them. To download all ingredients, use the manage.py command with the
  ``sync-ingredients`` option (see below).

``import-off-products``
  Imports and updates products from the Open Food Facts database. You can select
  whether to use a local file with the full database dump, the daily delta
  updates or use a mongo database, see the help for more information.




Management commands
-------------------

wger also implements a series of Django commands that perform different
management functions that are sometimes needed. Call them with
``python manage.py <command_name>``.

To retrieve a full list of available commands, call ``python manage.py`` without
any arguments and look under the app names (weight, nutrition, manager, core, exercises).
To get help on a specific command, call ``python manage.py <command_name> --help``.

Here are some of the most important ones:

``sync-ingredients[-async]``
  synchronizes the ingredient database from the default wger instance to the local
  installation. Ingredients that you added manually to the database are not touched.
  The ``async`` version uses celery to perform the task in the background. Also note
  that this will use around 1GB of disk space and takes several hours to complete.

``sync-exercises``
  synchronizes the exercise database from the default wger instance to the local
  installation. This will also update categories, equipment, languages, muscles
  and will delete entries that were removed on the remote server (this basically
  only applies to exercises that were submitted several times). Exercises that
  you added manually to the database are not touched.

``download-exercise-images``
  synchronizes the exercise images from the default wger instance to the local
  installation, does not overwrite existing images.

``download-exercise-videos``
  synchronizes the exercise videos from the default wger instance to the local
  installation, does not overwrite existing videos.

``exercises-health-check.py``
  Performs a series of basic health checks. Basically sees if there are exercises
  that don't have a default English translation or worse, don't have any
  translation at all

``extract-i18n``
  Used for development only. Extracts strings from the database that need to be
  translated. See the :ref:`i18n` section for more information.

``dummy-generator-*``
  Use to generate dummy data for the different entry types. For more information
  see the :ref:`dummy_generator` section.
