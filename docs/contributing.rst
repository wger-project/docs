Contributing
============

There are many different ways to help the project, you don't need to be a
developer to help out. Here are some ways you can contribute:


Exercises
---------

You can contribute new exercises, edit the existing ones, or contribute images
or videos. These contributions are just as important as code contributions, as
they help improve the overall quality and usability of the application.

Note that your account must be at least 3 weeks old and have a verified email.


Translations
------------
You can help translate the application using an online tool called Weblate.
