Using nutrition plans

Nutrition plans help you organize your daily meals and track macronutritients.

Creating a plan:

----------------
1. Go to **Nutrition -> Plans**.
2. Click **Add plan** and give it a name(e.g., "Cutting phase" or "High-protein").
3. Add meals (breakfast, lunch, etc.) and assign foods to each meal.
