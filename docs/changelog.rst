2.2
---
**2023-11-06**

https://github.com/wger-project/wger/releases/tag/2.2

üîß Upgrade steps from 2.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Update python libraries ``pip3 install -r requirements.txt``
* Migrate database ``python manage.py migrate``
* Update CSS and JS libraries ``yarn install``
* Compile the CSS ``yarn build:css:sass``
* Update static files (only production): ``python3 manage.py collectstatic``
* Load new permissions ``python3 manage.py loaddata groups.json categories.json``
* Read the section on celery in this documentation on how to set it up. While at the
  moment this is not needed and only provides quality of life features, in the future
  this might change



üöÄ Features
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Improvements to the nutritional plan handling. Users don't have to setup a detailed
  plan with meals anymore, instead they can just log their meals `#817`_
* Allow users to set goals for their nutritional plans. This basically works
  like the sum of the individual meals, but is simpler and easier to setup `#1003`_
* Implemented nutrition page with react
* Added general measurements tracking to the web application `#875`_
* Added JWT authentication to the REST API (thanks `@RohanKaran`_!) `#1047`_
* Added images to ingredients. This can now be shown in the nutritional plan,
  the autocompleter, etc. `#653`_
* Add a celery queue for longer running or periodic tasks. At the moment this is only used
  to keep the exercises in sync and download the ingredient images, but other features
  are planned `#1174`_
* When scanning a product, fetch the data from the live OFF server if it is not
  found locally `#1012`_, `#1348`_
* Added brute protection against brute force login attacks (thanks `@RohanKaran`_!) `#1096`_
* Reworked the landing page (thanks `@12people`_!) `#1112`_
* Allow to set the minimum account age for users to contribute exercises (thanks `@mohammadrafigh`_!) `#1187`_
* Document the API with openAPI, redoc and all the goodies that come from it
  (better online docs, being able to generate clients, etc.) `#1127`_
* Allow searching exercises and ingredient in English in addition to the user's
  currently selected language `#1238`_
* More flexible user (sub)locale switching. This specially affected English users
  that would be shown dates in US format `#1245`_
* Add a deletion log for exercises. This allows exercises to be marked as deleted by
  the system. Alternatively a replacement can be set so that when other instances
  sync the exercises logs and routines are correctly updated `#1237`_
* Show all the authors of an exercise and any of its child items (translations,
  images, videos, etc.) `#1137`_
* Allow users to give meals a description (thanks `@mohammadrafigh`_!) `#822`_
* Added style field (Foto, 3D, etc.) to exercise image (thanks `@LucasSD`_!) `#822`_
* Added exercise edit history (thanks `@ImTheTom`_!) `#1082`_
* Added JWT authentication to rest API (thanks `@RohanKaran`_!) `#1134`_
* Add support for sub-locales in the application such as en-gb  `#1275`_
* Moved some parts of routine management to react `#1328`_

üß∞ Maintenance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Improvements to the Open Food Facts product importer. The setup has been simplified
  with a docker compose, making the process much more streamlined. `#1505`_
* `#1137`_  (thanks `@AdamPetik`_!)
* Show last modified datetime of exercises in the API `#1387`_
* Better handling of exercises without translations `#1319`_
* Split the dummy generator into individual files `#919`_
* Update bootstrap to current version `#1109`_
* Update django to current version `#1110`_
* Bettler handling of exercises UUIDs (thanks `@Gr8ayu`_) `#675`_
* Add foreign key to meals on log (thanks `@Alig1493`_) `#842`_
* Make URL for media, static and login redirect configurable (thanks `@novalis111`_) `#1020`_
* Configure django axes (thanks `@RohanKaran`_) `#1143`_
* Add tzdate package to docker base image (thanks `@bbkz`_) `#1408`_


üêõ Bug Fixes

**2022-10-11**

Upgrade steps from 2.0:

* Install ffmpeg if you want to upload videos (consult documentation).
* Update python libraries ``pip3 install -r requirements.txt``
* To sync the new exercises:

  * Run migrations ``python3 manage.py migrate``
  * delete all exercises not in use ``python manage.py delete-unused-exercises``
    (this will delete all exercises that are currently in the database but are
    not part of any workout, log, etc. You will be promted before the script does anything)
  * get the new exercises ``python manage.py sync-exercises`` (Also note that if
    you don‚Äôt perform these steps and directly run a regular sync the worst
    that can happen is that you might have some duplicate exercises in your
    installation)
  * get the new images ``python manage.py download-exercise-images``
  * get the new videos ``python manage.py download-exercise-videos`` (please
    note that this needs more space)

* Update CSS and JS libraries ``yarn install``
* Compile the CSS ``yarn build:css:sass``
* Update static files (only production): ``python3 manage.py collectstatic``
* Load new permissions ``python3 manage.py loaddata groups.json categories.json``


üöÄ Features:

  submit, correct and translate the exercises. `#1120`_
* New gallery where users can upload pictures to track their progress `#572`_
* Exercises can now have videos. Also many thanks to Goulart for providing 150 videos `#970`_

* Adding a new workout day no longer needs to be saved twice (thanks `@ImTheTom`_) `#974`_

üß∞ Maintenance:

* Exercise API response is now cached (thanks `@ImTheTom`_) `#1033`_

* Changes to the REST API:

  + /exercisebaseinfo/
    - New endpoint to get exercise information grouped by the base exercise
  + /language/
    - Also expose the language ID
  + /exerciseimage/
    - ``exercise`` was renamed to  ``exercise_base`` (was pointing there anyway)
    - New field ``style``
  + /workout/
    - ``comment`` was renamed to name
    - field ``description`` was added, for longer descriptions
  + /set/
    - field ``comment`` added, for user notes
