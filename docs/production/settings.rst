Settings
========

You can configure some of the application behaviour with the ``WGER_SETTINGS``
dictionary in your settings file. Currently, the following options are supported:

**ALLOW_GUEST_USERS**: Default ``True``.
  Controls whether users can use the site as a guest user or if an administrator
  has to create the user accounts, as with the option above.

**ALLOW_REGISTRATION**: Default ``True``.
  Controls whether users can register on their own or if a gym administrator has
  to create the user accounts.

**DOWNLOAD_INGREDIENTS_FROM**: Default ``WGER``
  Where to download ingredient images from. Possible
  values are 'WGER' and 'OFF'. It is recommended to leave the default of WGER as
  to now hit the Open Food Facts with too many requests

**EMAIL_FROM**: Default ``wger Workout Manager <wger@example.com>``
  The sender address used for sent emails by the system such as weight reminders

**EXERCISE_CACHE_TTL**: Default ``3600``
  Sets how long the overview responses for exercise, exerciseinfo and exercisebaseinfo
  are cached for. The value is in seconds, so 3600 is one hour.

**MIN_ACCOUNT_AGE_TO_TRUST**: Default ``21``
  Users won't be able to contribute to exercises if their account age is
  lower than this amount in days.

**SYNC_EXERCISES_CELERY**: Default ``False``
  Whether to periodically synchronize the exercise database from the default wger
  instance. Needs celery to be configured.

**SYNC_EXERCISE_IMAGES_CELERY**: Default ``False``
  Whether to periodically synchronize the exercise images from the default wger
  instance. Needs celery to be configured.

**SYNC_EXERCISE_VIDEOS_CELERY**: Default ``False``
  Whether to periodically synchronize the exercise videos from the default wger
  instance. Needs celery to be configured.

**USE_CELERY**: Default ``False``.
  Whether celery is configured and can be used

**USE_RECAPTCHA**: Default ``False``.
  Controls whether a captcha challenge will be presented when new users register.

**WGER_INSTANCE**: Default ``https://wger.de``.
  The wger instance from which commands like exercise synchronization will use
  to fetch data from.


.. note::
  If you want to override a default setting, don't overwrite all the dictionary
  but only the keys you need, e.g. ``WGER_SETTINGS['foo'] = 'bar'``. This avoids
  problems when new keys are added in the global settings.

Set the URL for your site in the table ``django_site``. This is only used e.g. in
the password reset emails.
